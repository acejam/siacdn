# SiaCDN

This repository contains a set of projects that can be combined to run a service
that:

* Provisions new full Sia nodes
* Provisions Sia-powered Minio instances
* Charges a configurable rate for operations
* Receives payments in either SiaCoin (SC) or (optionally) U.S. Dollars ($)
* Provides user-facing administration via a hosted website


## Prime instance

The owner-supported instance of this service lives at https://siacdn.com - your
use of that instance will help support development of the projects in this
repository.
